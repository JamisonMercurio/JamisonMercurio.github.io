      <td class = "projectText"> 8puzzle solves a slider puzzle using the A* search algorithm. The puzzle is played on a n x n grid with n^2 - 1 square tiles labeled 1 through n^2 - 1, plus a blank square. The goal is to rearrange the tiles in row-major order with as few moves as possible. I implemented the program by creating a Board class that models a nxn board, calculates its hamming & manhattan distances, find possible neighboring boards, and determines whether a board is solvable. Then, I implemented the A* searching algorithm to solve the puzzle. </td>

      <td><img src="SeamCarving.png" alt="SeamCarvingImage" class="projectPhoto"></td></td>
    <td class = "projectText"> Seam Carving is an image resizing technique where the image is reduced in size by one pixel at a time. The algorithm finds a seam in the image with the lowest pixel energies so when the seam is removed, the image seems intact. I implemented the algorithm by first calculating the pixel of each seam, found the vertical seam of minimum total energy, and then removed the seam. To resize the image horizontally, i transposed the picture. </td>

      <td class = "projectText"> Burrows Wheeler implements the Burrows-Wheeler data compression algorithm and it outcompresses gzip and PKZIP. The algorithms utilizes three smaller algorithmic components. Burrows-Wheeler transform transforms a typical English text file to a text file in which sequences of same character occur near each other many times. Move-to-Front encoding converts the transfrom file into a text file in which certain characters appear more frequently than others. Finally, Huffman compression compresses the move-to-front file by encoding frquently occuring characters with short codewords and infrequently occuring characters with long codewords.</td>

      <td><img src="Autocomplete.png" alt="AutocompleteImage" class="projectPhoto"></td>
      <td class = "projectText"> Autocomplete finds all the terms beginning with a given prefix, in descending order by weight. It functions very similar to the search bar on the Google search engine. I implemented the program by sorting the terms by query string, using binary search to find all query strings that start with a given string, and sorting the matching terms by weight. </td>
