        <b>Short Summary:</b> <br/> <br/>
        I am a third year Informatics student, very interested in giving back to a university that has given me <br/>
        so much over my time here. I’ve formed friendships and made so many memories at Edinburgh, whether <br/>
        it was at Hive, Why Not, Southsider, or Pear Tree – not to mention the infamous pre’s I used to throw at Kincaid’s. <br/>
        I also have many outside interests, including running, breakdancing, hiking, gaming, and SCUBA diving.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <br/>
        
        <b>Platform:</b> <br/>
        I have put together a list of goals I will tackle as EUSA President, created based on a wide <br/>
         variety of student feedback. Here are some of the ideas I will implement: <br/> <br/>
        • Free Food and Drink: Unlimited haggis buffets in Teviot during Lounge Café hours, and bi-weekly whiskey <br/>
          tastings free of charge throughout the semester. <br/> <br/>
        • City Experiences: In order to help students experience Edinburgh’s history and culture, I’d like to subsidize <br/>
          trips to various parts of the city. To that end, I will organize a giant end-of-term party in Edinburgh Castle, <br/>
          with an open bar. <br/> <br/>
        • Promoting Transparency: With classes, societies, and social lives, it’s hard for students to follow what is going on <br/>
         at the EUSA officer level. Accordingly, I’ll organize an annual meet and greet with the EUSA Student President (me). <br/> <br/>
        • Free Willy. <br/> <br/>
        
        These are just some of the many accomplishments I hope to achieve over the course of the year as your EUSA president,  <br/>
        and I intend to update and prioritize this list accordingly based off of my conversations with fellow students.  <br/> <br/>
        
        I’m looking forward to talking to many more of you in the coming weeks ahead!
        <br>
